This is for the full stack test:

Completed tasks:
- Created log in page using email and password
- Create employee management page with functionalities:
    - Show list employees
    - Create/edit employee detail
    
TODO tasks:
- autocomplete search api (Not sure about the requirement, worked with guzzle before but not sure where it can apply for the task...)
- the function authenticateUsing doesn't work as expected so can't have option use username/email to login at the moment :(

Intruction:
- Start php admin server
- Set up new user (default username:root, password: password, or can change in config)
- Open terminal, run "php artisan serve"
- Go to the http://localhost:8000/home to checkout :D
